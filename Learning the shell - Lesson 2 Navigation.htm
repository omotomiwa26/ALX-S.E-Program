    </div><h1>Navigation</h1>

<p>In this lesson, we will introduce our first three commands: <code class="user"><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/pwdh.html">pwd</a></code> (print working
directory), <code class="user"><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/cdh.html">cd</a></code>
(change directory), and <code class="user"><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/ls1.html">ls</a></code> (list files and directories).</p>

<p>Those new to the command line will need to pay close attention to this
lesson since the concepts will take some getting used to.</p>

<h2>File System Organization</h2>

<p>Like Windows, the files on a Linux system are arranged in what is called a
<i>hierarchical directory structure</i>. This means that they are organized in
a tree-like pattern of <i>directories</i> (called folders in other systems),
which may contain files and <i>subdirectories</i>. The first directory in the
file system is called the <i>root directory</i>. The root directory contains
files and subdirectories, which contain more files and subdirectories and so on
and so on.</p>

<p>Most graphical environments include a file manager program used to view and
manipulate the contents of the file system. Often we will see the file system
represented like this:

<img src="Learning%20the%20shell%20-%20Lesson%202%20Navigation_files/file_manager.jpg" alt="directory tree"></p>

<p>One important difference between Windows and Unix-like operating systems
such as Linux is that Linux does not employ the concept of drive letters. While
Windows drive letters split the file system into a series of different trees
(one for each device), Linux always has a single tree. Different storage
devices may be different branches of the tree, but there is always just a
single tree.</p>

<h2>pwd</h2>

<p>Since the command line interface cannot provide graphic pictures of the file
system structure, we must have a different way of representing it. To do this,
think of the file system tree as a maze, and that we are standing in it. At any
given moment, we are located in a single directory. Inside that directory, we
can see its files and the pathway to its <i>parent directory</i> and the
pathways to the subdirectories of the directory in which we are standing.</p>

<p>The directory we are standing in is called the <i>working directory</i>. To
see the name of the working directory, we use the <code class="user">pwd</code>
command.</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">pwd</code>
/home/me</div>

<p>When we first log on to our Linux system, the working directory is set to
our <i>home directory</i>.  This is where we put our files. On most systems,
the home directory will be called /home/user_name, but it can be anything
according to the whims of the system administrator.</p>

<p>To list the files in the working directory, we use the <code class="user">ls</code> command.</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ls</code>
Desktop    Downloads         foo.txt  Pictures  Templates
Documents  examples.desktop  Music    Public    Videos</div>

<p>We will come back to <code class="user">ls</code> in the next lesson. There
are a lot of fun things you can do with it, but we have to talk about pathnames
and directories a bit first.</p>

<h2>cd</h2>

<p>To change the working directory (where we are standing in the maze) we use
the <code class="user">cd</code> command. To do this, we type <code class="user">cd</code> followed by the <i>pathname</i> of the desired working
directory. A pathname is the route we take along the branches of the tree to
get to the directory we want. Pathnames can be specified two different ways;
<i>absolute pathnames</i> or <i>relative pathnames</i>. Let's look with
absolute pathnames first.</p>

<p>An absolute pathname begins with the root directory and follows the tree
branch by branch until the path to the desired directory or file is completed.
For example, there is a directory on your system in which most programs are
installed. The pathname of the directory is <code>/usr/bin</code>. This means
from the root directory (represented by the leading slash in the pathname)
there is a directory called "usr" which contains a directory called "bin".</p>

<p>Let's try this out:</p>

<div class="display">me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">cd /usr/bin</code>
me@linuxbox bin]$ <code class="cmd">pwd</code>
/usr/bin
me@linuxbox bin]$ <code class="cmd">ls</code>
'['                                   mshortname
 2to3-2.7                             mshowfat
 411toppm                             mtools
 a2ps                                 mtoolstest
 a2ps-lpr-wrapper                     mtr
 aa-enabled                           mtrace
 aa-exec                              mtr-packet
 aclocal                              mtvtoppm
 aclocal-1.15                         mtype
 aconnect                             mutter
 acpi_listen                          mxtar
 add-apt-repository                   mzip
 addpart                              namei

and many more...</div>

<p>Now we can see that we have changed the current working directory to
<code>/usr/bin</code> and that it is full of files. Notice how the shell prompt
has changed?  As a convenience, it is usually set up to display the name of the
working directory.</p>

<p>Where an absolute pathname starts from the root directory and leads to its
destination, a relative pathname starts from the working directory. To do this,
it uses a couple of special notations to represent relative positions in the
file system tree. These special notations are "." (dot) and ".." (dot dot).</p>

<p>The "." notation refers to the working directory itself and the ".."
notation refers to the working directory's parent directory. Here is how it
works. Let's change the working directory to /usr/bin again:</p>

<div class="display">me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">cd /usr/bin</code>
me@linuxbox bin]$ <code class="cmd">pwd</code>
/usr/bin</div>

<p>O.K., now let's say that we wanted to change the working directory to the
parent of <code>/usr/bin</code> which is <code>/usr</code>. We could do that
two different ways. First, with an absolute pathname:</p>

<div class="display">me@linuxbox bin]$ <code class="cmd">cd /usr</code>
me@linuxbox usr]$ <code class="cmd">pwd</code>
/usr</div>

<p>Or, with a relative pathname:</p>

<div class="display">me@linuxbox bin]$ <code class="cmd">cd ..</code>
me@linuxbox usr]$ <code class="cmd">pwd</code>
/usr</div>

<p>Two different methods with identical results. Which one should we use? The
one that requires the least typing!</p>

<p>Likewise, we can change the working directory from <code>/usr</code> to
<code>/usr/bin</code> in two different ways. First using an absolute
pathname:</p>

<div class="display">me@linuxbox usr]$ <code class="cmd">cd /usr/bin</code>
me@linuxbox bin]$ <code class="cmd">pwd</code>
/usr/bin</div>

<p>Or, with a relative pathname:</p>

<div class="display">me@linuxbox usr]$ <code class="cmd">cd ./bin</code>
me@linuxbox bin]$ <code class="cmd">pwd</code>
/usr/bin</div>

<p>Now, there is something important that we must point out here. In most
cases, we can omit the "./". It is implied. Typing:</p>

<div class="display">me@linuxbox usr]$ <code class="cmd">cd bin</code></div>

<p>would do the same thing. In general, if we do not specify a pathname to
something, the working directory will be assumed. There is one important
exception to this, but we won't get to that for a while.</p>

<h2>A Few Shortcuts</h2>

<p>If we type <code class="user">cd</code> followed by nothing, <code class="user">cd</code> will change the working directory to our home
directory.</p>

<p>A related shortcut is to type <code class="user">cd
~<i>user_name</i></code>. In this case, <code class="user">cd</code> will
change the working directory to the home directory of the specified user.</p>

<p>Typing <code class="user">cd -</code> changes the working
directory to the previous one.</p>

  <h2>Important facts about file names</h2>

  <ol>

    <li><p>File names that begin with a period character are hidden. This only
    means that <code class="user">ls</code> will not list them unless we say
    <code class="user">ls -a</code>. When your account was created, several
    hidden files were placed in your home directory to configure things for
    your account. Later on we will take a closer look at some of these files to
    see how you can customize our <i>environment</i>. In addition, some
    applications will place their configuration and settings files in your home
    directory as hidden files.</p></li>

    <li><p>File names in Linux, like Unix, are case sensitive. The file names
    "File1" and "file1" refer to different files.</p></li>

    <li><p>Linux has no concept of a "file extension" like Windows systems. You
    may name files any way you like. However, while Linux itself does not care
    about file extensions, many application programs do.</p></li>

    <li><p>Though Linux supports long file names which may contain embedded
    spaces and punctuation characters, limit the punctuation characters to
    period, dash, and underscore. <strong>Most importantly, do not embed spaces
    in file names.</strong> If you want to represent spaces between words in a
    file name, use underscore characters. You will thank yourself
    later.</p></li>
